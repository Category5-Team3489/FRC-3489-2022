// Needs to happen before SMR
Functionality:
    Two simple autos:
        1: Shoot ball, back up out of tarmac
        2: Shoot ball, back up, pick up ball, move forward, shoot, backup
    Shooting from launch pad shooter speeds, with no centering
    Shoot speed scaling based on distance
    May not need ButtonShootWrongColor, could use to shoot from launch pad






Testing:
    Test climbing
    Test intake
    Make simple auto and test

// Not completely necessary
Use built in PID on motor controllers for centering the robot to auto aim

// Really want
Prevent bagpipe intake falcon, reverse intake
Find current draw to prevent bagpipe falcon on winch
PID drive with new drive motors
PID turn with new motors
Map ball trajectory
Scale shooter speed based on distances
Shooter velocity control with PID

// Really want not completely necessary
Move pid stuff so can be used in teleop
Turning button during tele if turning pid works well?
Test ball spin for helping accuracy

// Scouting
Improve going through scouting data and ordering teams for alliance selection
Team previewer show 3 teams at once and compare data
Displaying robot picture in team previewer from pit scouting
Look over scouting questions
Improve team previewer
No human player question for scouting, too hard to answer, bryan said???
Heatmap for scouting somehow?

// General
Decrease CAN traffic
Think about intake, how to index, may be indexing to far, or stopping to fast when cargo hits laser sensor
Current limiting motors?, 342 guy said may help
Optimizing other motor speeds
Optimizing climing sequence speed, maybe make winch faster, combine first 2 instructions
Handling ball count at beginning of match
Organize constants

// Check later
Spam setting pnuematics?
Stop spam setting cargo transfer handler

// Notes
// negative up on climber

// Decisions
// Reset method for handlers? Can just put a disabled init in there
// Got rid of slew limiting, wheelie rollers on robot now

// Think about
Hash code for shuffleboard simple widgets to avoid setting unnessisarily, or maybe not????/
Button debouncer
Dynamically defining instructions, may need value providers for dynamic instruction imput, boolean provider, double provider
Camera tracking balls
Document auto framework
Logger handler
Fix 2 drive docs
Get class name method in RobotReferences? for logger
Tagging auto instructions so only certain ones can be cancelled

// Useful info
// look at Zieglerâ€“Nichols tuning
