-- Morning --
figure out climber
auto


FIx cargo mover colliding sets in drive auto aim, increase tolarances
limelight filtering


----On field----
Limelight calibration
Code to switch pipelines based on alliance in drivestation programatically
get simple auto and 2 simple autos

Decrease index dist?

-- Pit TODO important
Make intake better

LOWER CLIMB DRIVE SPEED?

auto aim x-axis

-- practice field --
get friction constant for auto aim turn
get friction constant for auto aim drive
neo drive stuff

-- Improvements --
Position threshold for limelight centering, if already close, dont correct?
R and B alliance pipelines if needed

-- Future --
If time:
Make an auto instruction that uses encoder clicks than stops motors when hit target
Log file shooter rps -> shooter pid? if needed

????
Slight shooter speed scaling based on range
