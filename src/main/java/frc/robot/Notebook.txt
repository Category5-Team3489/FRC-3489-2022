What are class scope and method scope in java?
    The class scope is the area directly inside of a class, not inside of the methods in the class
    Examples:
        public class DriveHandler {
            // everything in this is in this layer is in the class scope
            // anything in the methods in this class is NOT class scope
            // the method declarations themself are in the class scope
            // but NOT the code inside of the methods

            // class-scoped primative type variable
            private int step = 10;

            // class-scoped class type variable
            private WPI_TalonFX falcon = new WPI_TalonFX()
        }


What are primative data types in java?

    All of the following are considered primative types in java:
        int, byte, short, long, float, double, boolean, char
        There is also String, which is treated like a primative in its declaration.

    How is a primative data type declared?
        Ignore what scoped means until you read below
        Method-scoped primative type variable declarations:
            type name;
            type name = value;
            Examples:
                int step;
                int step = 10; // This is pretty much always used

        Class-scoped primative type variable declarations:
            type name;
            type name = value;
            accessModifier type name;
            accessModifier type name = value;
            Examples:
                int step;
                int step = 10;
                private int step;
                private int step = 10; // This is pretty much always used

        Primative variable declarations do NOT use the keyword new OR class constructors

        Notice method-scoped variables can NOT include an access modifier
        Only class-scoped variables can include an access modifier: private, public
        because that variable only lives in that method unless it is returned
        or something is assigned to it that lives outside of the method scope

        A variable's value cannot be read BEFORE it is assigned

What are class types in java?

    Class types are effectively everything other data type other than primative types

    A motor controller type is a class type
    A joystick type is a class type
    A timer type is a class type
    A color sensor type is a class type
    A class you declare is a class type
    A class you use is a class type

    How is a class type declared, as in a variable?
        Method-scoped class type variable declarations:
            type name;
            type name
